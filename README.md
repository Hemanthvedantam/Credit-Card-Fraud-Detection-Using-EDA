**🌟 Overview**

This project, completed during my Geeksmetrics Internship, focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning.



**🔍 Key Features**


**EDA Techniques:** Comprehensive data exploration and visualization to uncover hidden patterns.


**Data Preprocessing:** Handling imbalanced datasets and feature engineering.


**Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of supervised learning algorithms to classify fraudulent transactions effectively.


**Model Evaluation:** Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for robust performance assessment.
